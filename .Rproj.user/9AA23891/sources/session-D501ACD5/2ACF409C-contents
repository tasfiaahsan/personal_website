abstract: "Humans constantly use depth information to support perceptual decisions
  about object size and location in space, as well as planning and executing actions.
  It was recently reported that perceived depth modulates perceptual performance even
  when depth information is not relevant to the task, with faster shape discrimination
  for objects perceived as being close to the observer. However, it is yet to be determined
  if the observed “close advantage” reflects differences in psychophysical sensitivity
  response bias. Moreover, it is unclear whether this advantage is generalizable to
  other viewing situations and tasks. To address these outstanding issues, we evaluated
  whether visual resolution is modulated by perceived depth defined by 2D pictorial
  cues. In a series of experiments, we used the method of constant stimuli to measure
  the precision of perceptual judgements for stimuli positioned at close, far, and
  flat perceived distances. In Experiment 1, we found that size discrimination was
  more precise when the object was perceived to be closer to the observers. Experiments
  2a and 2b extended this finding to a visual property orthogonal to depth information,
  by showing superior orientation discrimination for “close” objects. Finally, Experiment
  3 demonstrated that the close advantage also occurs when performing high-level perceptual
  tasks such as face perception. Taken together, our results provide novel evidence
  that the perceived depth of an object, as defined by pictorial cues, modulates the
  precision of visual processing for close objects."
summary: We live in a 3d world where objects appear at different distances relative
  to our body. In this experiment, we showed novel evidence that objects that appear
  close to us are processed more precisely and accurately than those that appear further
  away. This unique processing benefit for closer things is called the close advantage
  effect.
